For the avoidance of doubt, use within your own company or organization to deploy internal applications or environments is permitted under this Additional Use Grant.

Commercial licenses are available for companies that want to:
- include {project_name} in proprietary software, or
- offer {project_name}-based hosting or PaaS/SaaS solutions. +
Please contact us at *contact@clicqo.nl* for commercial licensing terms.
